# PyTest_Examples
A repository for Pytest and different ways to automate Pytest. 
We will be going over popular tools such as Selenium, Appium, Webdriver, and some other cool and fun stuff.
I will be coding on a Windows machine so hopefully anyone following along will keep that in mind!

## HOW TO

### Python
First we need to install python and all the stuff relating to this testing suite.
Go here to download! -> https://www.python.org/downloads/

### Pip and Python?
Make sure that you have pip and python both working in your terminal.
You can check this by doing pip --version and python --version Make sure they work!

### Installing Pytest, Selenium, etc
*** OPTIONAL STEP *** </br>
If you don't want to save certain pip installations to your current Python path, you can make a virtual environment and do all the fun stuff in there too without downloading it to your main Python path!
The command for python 3 is: </br>
<b>python -m pip install virtualenv</b> </br>
Then when that is done, do </br>
<b>python -m venv (NAME OF YOUR VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT)</b> </br>
Then you go into the new virtual environment and you then activate it using a script meant for your configurations. </br>
Different OS's and different terminals run different things these are what i've figured out so far: </br>
* Unix/Linux: activate
* Windows(cmd prompt): activate.bat
* Windows(powershell): Activate.ps1
